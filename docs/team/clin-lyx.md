### Project Medbook

MedBook - Medbook streamlines patient management for healthcare professionals. It simplifies the process of accessing patients' contact information and medical records, making it easier for healthcare providers to efficiently coordinate care.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view patient's medical records.
  * What it does: allows the user to view medical records of different patient.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can visualize the medical records.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing ui layout. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands, creation of new classes, formatting of the visuals of medical record card and reformatting the overall ui layout.
  * Wrote tests for view feature to increase coverage from 78% to 87% (Pull requests [\#42]())

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=clin-lyx&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)
