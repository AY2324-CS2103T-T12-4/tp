### Project Medbook

MedBook is a desktop application crafted specifically for doctors and medical administrative assistants of private clinics. It offers an intuitive and efficient interface for seamless management of patient details and medical records, enabling healthcare professionals to easily monitor and access patient information.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to view patient's medical records.

  - What it does: allows the user to view medical records of different patient.
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can visualize the medical records.
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects existing ui layout. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands, creation of new classes, formatting of the visuals of medical record card and reformatting the overall ui layout.
